    "\n",
    "Tourism is one of the key drivers of Tanzania’s economic and social development. The country is globally known for its iconic attractions such as Serengeti National Park, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Zanzibar beaches, which draw millions of visitors annually. In recent years, Tanzania has ranked among the world’s top tourist destinations, with tourism contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings, job creation, and community development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this growth, there is limited data-driven understanding of visitor trends, seasonal patterns, revenue generation, and source markets. Without such insights, it becomes challenging for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and ensure sustainable development of the sector. Data analysis is therefore essential to uncover patterns, measure performance, and identify opportunities for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this dataset is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tourism in Tanzania to examine trends in visitor arrivals, seasonal variations, and revenue contributions. Insights from this analysis will help inform data-driven strategies to strengthen tourism’s role in economic growth and improve decision-making for sustainable sector development."
