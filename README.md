### **ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction: Tourism Sector in Tanzania**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Tourism is one of Tanzaniaâ€™s largest economic drivers, known for its rich wildlife, cultural heritage, and world-class destinations. This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on tourism data to extract insights about visitor trends and develops a **classification model** to predict tourism outcomes such as visitor flow categories and market segments.

The results aim to empower policymakers, stakeholders, and tourism boards to make **evidence-based decisions** for sustainable growth of the sector.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Study **visitor demographics**, **spending patterns**, and **seasonal trends**.
   - Analyze **tour package preferences** and **popular activities**.
   - Identify **top source countries** for tourists.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**

   - Build a **classification model** to predict:

     - Tourist flow categories (e.g., **"High"**, **"Medium"**, **"Low"**).
     - Tourist segmentation based on origin or package selection.

   - Provide data-driven insights for strategic planning.

## ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing

- Fixed column naming inconsistencies (e.g., `infor_source â†’ info_source`).
- Created **`nights_stayed`**: sum of nights spent in mainland and Zanzibar.
- Combined package-related columns into **`package_services`** as a readable string.
- Dropped redundant columns after feature engineering.

---

## ðŸ“Š EDA Coverage

- Distribution of tourists by **age group, country, and travel companions**.
- Analysis of **purpose of visit** and **main activities**.
- Spending analysis using **`total_cost`**.
- Seasonal and stay-duration patterns.
- **Package preferences** (e.g., transport, accommodation, sightseeing).
- Visualization of top source markets.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** (data cleaning and manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (visualizations)

---

## ðŸ”® Predictive Modeling Approach

- **Type of Problem**: Classification
- **Target Variable Examples**:

  - Tourist flow level (**High/Medium/Low**) based on seasonal data.
  - Tourist market segment based on country or package choice.

- Potential Models:

  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Insights

- Identify **peak seasons** and low visitor periods for strategic planning.
- Recognize **high-spending tourist segments** to optimize revenue.
- Understand package service preferences for targeted offerings.
- Provide predictive insights to help resource allocation and marketing campaigns.

Would you like me to **add a "Sample Visualizations Section"** (with example matplotlib charts like tourist distribution by country, spending histogram, etc.) in this README?
