    "Tourism is a vital pillar of Tanzania’s economy, contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings, employment, and community development. Renowned globally for attractions such as Serengeti National Park, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Zanzibar beaches, the country draws millions of visitors annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is limited data-driven understanding of visitor demographics, seasonal patterns, and revenue drivers. This lack of insight hinders informed decision-making for policymakers, tourism boards, and stakeholders, resulting in inefficiencies in marketing strategies, resource allocation, and sustainable sector planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, there is a need to analyze historical tourism data to uncover patterns in tourist arrivals, spending, preferences, and peak seasons. Furthermore, a predictive model can be developed to classify and forecast tourist flow levels (e.g., \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\") and segment visitors based on key attributes like source market or package preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with predictive modeling, this project aims to provide actionable insights and build a foundation for data-driven decision-making in Tanzania’s tourism sector."

    "* **Tourism Activities**: Visitors prefer wildlife and beach tourism over cultural or business-related tourism.\n",
    "* **Information Source**: Tourists are more likely to learn about Tanzania through travel agents, friends, or relatives than through TV, radio, web platforms, magazines, or Tanzanian missions abroad.\n",
    "* **Tour Arrangement**: Visitors prefer arranging tours independently rather than opting for package tours.\n",
    "* **Payment Method**: Cash is the most common mode of payment among visitors, compared to credit cards or travelers' cheques.\n",
    "* **Trip Frequency**: A majority of visitors are on their first trip to Tanzania rather than being repeat travelers.\n",
    "* **Visitor Impressions**: Visitors are more likely to appreciate the friendliness of Tanzanians compared to giving feedback on experiences or overall satisfaction.\n",
    "* **Pricing Preference**: Most visitors prefer reasonably priced services rather than low-cost or high-cost options.\n",
    "* **Length of Stay**: The typical length of stay for visitors is up to two weeks.\n",
    "* **Destination Preference**: Visitors spend more time in Zanzibar than on mainland Tanzania.\n",
