    "### **1. Understand the Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tourism is a vital pillar of Tanzania’s economy, contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings, employment, and community development. Renowned globally for attractions such as Serengeti National Park, Mount Kilimanjaro, and Zanzibar beaches, the country draws millions of visitors annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is limited data-driven understanding of visitor demographics, seasonal patterns, and revenue drivers. This lack of insight hinders informed decision-making for policymakers, tourism boards, and stakeholders, resulting in inefficiencies in marketing strategies, resource allocation, and sustainable sector planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, there is a need to analyze historical tourism data to uncover patterns in tourist arrivals, spending, preferences, and peak seasons. Furthermore, a predictive model can be developed to classify and forecast tourist flow levels (e.g., \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\") and segment visitors based on key attributes like source market or package preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with predictive modeling, this project aims to provide actionable insights and build a foundation for data-driven decision-making in Tanzania’s tourism sector.\n",
